...with this quiz.

Originally presented to the [bitcoin-dev mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-February/019998.html). (Only ZmnSCPxj answered, and he did not do particularly well.)

Here it is:

### Section 1

0. We could change DC to make miner-theft impossible, by making it a layer1 consensus rule that miners never steal. Why is this cure worse than the disease?
1. If 100% hashrate wanted to steal coins from a DC sidechain *as quickly as possible*, how long would this take (in blocks)?
2. Per sidechain per year (ie, per 52560 blocks), how many DC withdrawals can take place (maximum)? How many can be attempted?
      (Ie, how does the 'train track metaphor' work, from ~1h5m in the "Overview and Misconceptions" video)?
3. Only two types of people should ever be using the DC withdrawal system at all.
   3a. Which two?
   3b. How is everyone else, expected to move their coins from chain to chain?
   3c. (Obviously, this improves UX.) But why does it also improve security?

### Section 2

4. What do the parameters b and m stand for (in the DC security model)?
5. How can m possibly be above 1? Give an example of a sidechain-attribute which may cause this situation to arise.
6. For which range of m, is DC designed to deter sc-theft?
7. If DC could be changed to magically deter theft across all ranges of m, why would that be bad for sidechain users in general?

### Section 3

8. If imminent victims of a DC-based theft, used a mainchain UASF to prohibit the future theft-withdrawal, then how would this affect non-DC users?
9. In what ways might the BTC network one day become uncompetitive? And how is this different from caring about a sidechain's m and b?

### Section 4

10. If DC were successful, Altcoin-investors would be harmed. Two Maximalist-groups would also be slightly harmed -- who are these?

Should I provide the answers?? Well, most of the answers are somewhere on drivechain.info -- try the Peer Review section or the FAQ or the original spec.
